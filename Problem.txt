A file has genealogy data for a collection of N people. The first line of the file contains the integer N followed by N additional lines of data. Each of these additional lines specifies a list of children for a single person. The line starts with the name of the person, followed by the number of that personâ€™s children, followed by the names of the children. Here is an example of a file specifying genealogy information for 10 people.

10
Al 3 Beth Carol Dino
Beth 1 Pablo
Carol 3 Ben Alex Mary
Dino 0
Pablo 2 Angela Miguel
Ben 0
Alex 0
Mary 0
Angela 0
Miguel 0

For example, Al has three children named Beth, Carol, and Dino; Beth has one child named Pablo; and Dino has no children. You may assume that all names are unique.
Write a program which reads a file of genealogy information and then allows the user to enter pairs of names X and Y. The program then determines whether Y is a descendant of X, and if so, prints a list of names beginning with X and ending with Y, such that each person in the chain is a child of person preceding them on the list. Otherwise, the program states that Y is not a descendant of X.
